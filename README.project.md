# Download CPTAC3 batch d3 data

Consists of the following UCEC cases:
  * C3L-01925, C3N-01346, C3N-01349

Based on Dan Cui request (email, 7/2/18).  These dont have WXS data associated with them.

To obtain the SR file, we use the C325 cases and SR files, which form a superset of SR entries.
As a first step, we extract only those cases we want, and generate an ad hoc SR file we will use.
